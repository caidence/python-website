	  <h3>The basics</h3>
	  <p>In Python, everything is an object, and every object has a data type. In the previous tutorial, you
	    learned about strings, which are one of the many Python data types. In Python, we would say that 
        a String, for example, is a <i>string</i> data type. There are many data types in Python.
        This tutorial is a brief high-level overview of some of the most common data types in Python 3. I will 
        cover each data type in detail in later tutorials, this is just an introduction to get your feet wet.
        Because you learned about strings in the last tutorial, this tutorial will skip strings and pick up where
        we left off. Lets take a look at another common data type, the integer.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>int</h3>
	  <p>Int, short for integer, is a whole number with no decimal place. Ints do not have a decimal even
	    if the decimal value is zero. Ints can be positive or negative. Do not make the mistake of putting
        quotation marks around a number, this will make the data type of the object a string rather than an int,
        which can cause you a whole lot of headache later in your program!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	 <div class="right code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># These are valid ints</span><br>
		  2. <span class="green">1078</span><br>
		  3. <span class="purple">-</span><span class="green">1078</span><br>
		  4. <br>
		  5. <span class="light-gray"># These are not ints</span><br>
		  6. <span class="red">"1078"</span>&nbsp;&nbsp<span class="light-gray"># This is a sting</span><br>
		  7. <span class="green">1078.0</span>&nbsp;&nbsp<span class="light-gray"># This is a float</span>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In the example, lines two and three are both valid ints. Ints can be basically any number that
	    you want, so long as the number does not have a decimal place. Lines six and seven are not ints,
		which is slightly confusing to newcomers. They are both valid data types, but line six is a string and
        line seven is a float. Line six is a string due to being enclosed in quotes, and line seven has a decimal,
        making it a float. It is important to understand that on line seven, even though the decimal value is 
        zero, which by definition makes it a whole number, it is still considered a float because of the decimal,
        not an int.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Float</h3>
	  <div class="left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># Examples of float data type</span><br>
		  2. <span class="purple">-</span><span class="green">192090.000</span><br>
		  3. <span class="green">1234.56789</span><br>
		  4. <span class="green">1.0</span>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>If you understand ints, it won't take too much explanation for you to understand floats. Float is
	    short for <i>floating point number</i>. This basically means numbers that are not whole numbers. Floating
        point numbers always contain a decimal. Like ints, floats can be positive or negative. The important thing
        to remember is that if a number has a decimal, it is a float, not an int. 	
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>List</h3>
	  <p>Lists (often called arrays in other languages) are the most general sequence in Python. Lists are 
        <i>mutable</i> objects, meaning that it is possible to change the value of a list in place. By definition, 
	    lists are positionally ordered sequences of arbitrary objects. This means that they are used to 
	    store any object type in sequential order by position. In layman's terms, a list is an object that stores 
        other objects. You create a list by using square brackets [ ] and everything between is stored in the list.
        You separate objects using a comma "," between them in the square brackets. For instance, say you had two
        strings: "foo" and "bar", and you want to create an object that stores both strings, but keeps them separate
        from each other. You can use a list! The code would look something like this: ["foo", "bar"]. This will
        keep the strings separate from one another and store them in a single list data type.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
      <code>
	    <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	      1. <span class="light-gray"># Examples of lists</span><br>
  		  2. [<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>, <span class="green">3</span>]<br>
		  3. [<span class="green">1.1</span>, <span class="green">2.2</span>, <span class="green">3.3</span>]<br>
		  4. [<span class="red">"a"</span>, <span class="red">"b"</span>, <span class="red">"c"</span>]<br>
		  5. [<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">3.7</span>, <span class="red">"hi!"</span>]
	    </div>
      </code>
	  <p>Generally speaking, lists contain only one data type, meaning a list of all ints or a list of all floats.
	    This is often the case, but not always. Unlike many other languages, in Python you can put multiple data 
		types in the same list. In fact, you can put any data type you want in your list, even other lists! In the
		example, you can see the basic syntax of a list.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Tuple</h3>
	  <p>Tuples are much the same as lists. The main difference between lists and tuples is that tuples are 
        <i>immutable</i>. This means that you cannot change a tuple in place like you can with a list. You cannot
        add or remove items from a tuple like you can to a list. Tuple syntax is exactly the same as list syntax,
        the only difference is you use ( ) instead of [ ] to create a tuple.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>If you cannot change tuples, then why not just use lists always? Good question, imaginary student!
        Tuples have some advantages over lists that are worth noting here. Firstly, tuples cannot be changed.
        This makes your code "safer" when working with data. You'd be surprised how easy it is to accidently
        change a list in your code. Secondly, tuple iteration is faster than list iteration. If your only
        intention is to iterate over the data, you should use a tuple because it would be faster than using a list.
        Does list vs tuple iteration speed really matter too much? No. Tuple iteration is not noticeably faster than 
        list iteration, but it is faster, nevertheless. Thirdly, tuples take up less space in memory than lists.
        This is due to the fact that lists take up extra memory behind the scenes for possible expansion.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># Tuple examples</span><br>
		  2. (<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>, <span class="green">3</span>)<br>
		  3. (<span class="green">1.1</span>, <span class="green">2.2</span>, <span class="green">3.3</span>)<br>
		  4. (<span class="red">"a"</span>, <span class="red">"b"</span>, <span class="red">"c"</span>)<br>
		  5. (<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">3.7</span>, <span class="red">"hi!"</span>)<br>
		  6. (<span class="green">1</span>,)<br>
		  7. <br>
		  8. (<span class="green">1</span>) <span class="light-gray"># Not a tuple</span>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Like lists, you can put any data type you want into a tuple. It can contain all just one data type,
	    or you can have multiple data types in a tuple, it's up to you! Also like lists, you can put tuples
		inside of your tuple. Unlike lists, if you want a tuple of just one item, you must put a comma after the item, like on
		line six of the example. If you do not put the trailing comma, Python will interpret the data type to be
		that of the data type of the item, not a tuple! For example, line eight is not a tuple. Python interprets
		this line as an int because the item in the braces is an int and there is no trailing comma after it.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Dictionary</h3>
	  <p>Dictionaries can be difficult to understand, so try to take this section slow. If you are comming from 
        another language, a dictionary in Python is just a hash table. Dictionaries are lists of
        mutable key value pairs. The main use of a dictionary is to extract the value using the key. Dictionaries
        are created using { }. Key value pairs are separated using a comma and keys and values are separated using
        a colon ":". For more clarity, check out the example. We will discuss dictionaries in depth in a later
        tutorial.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="right code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># Dictionary examples</span><br>
		  2. {key1: value1, key2: value2}<br>
		  3. {<span class="red">'name'</span>: <span class="red">'bob'</span>, <span class="red">'age'</span>: <span class="green">26</span>}
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In the examples, you can see that there are key value pairs (key: value) in the dictionaries. On line two,
        key1 is associated with value1. This is what we call a key value pair. Also notice that the key and value
        are separated by a colon and the key value pairs are separated by a comma. The key is always on the left
        side of the colon and the value on the right. Keys don't have to just be strings, they can be ints and floats
        if you want. It is just important that every key is unique. If two or more keys have the same name, Python
        will only grab the value associated with the last most key in the dictionary.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># The value of 1 is 'hello'</span><br>
		  2. {<span class="green">1</span>: <span class="red">'hi'</span>, <span class="green">1</span>: <span class="red">'hola'</span>,
      		 <span class="green">1</span>: <span class="red">'hello'</span>}
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>This example shows Python's behavior if you use the same key name more than once. If you try to get the
        value at 1 in this dictionary, the value will be 'hello' because that is the value at the last key with the
        name 1. Python will ignore all of the other values. This is why you should make sure your keys are unique.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>set</h3>
	  <p>Python sets work the same as those used in mathematics. The operations used in Python on sets work the
        same as set operations in mathematics, too. Some set operations are union, disjoint, and difference. Sets
        are mutable objects in Python. We will get to sets in a later tutorial, but for now, the important thing
        to remember is the order of a set does not matter and sets can only contain unique items. How you create
        a set is basically the same as how you create a list or tuple, except you use { } instead of [ ] or ( ).
        It is unlikely that you will use sets very often in Python, unless you are a mathematician or data scientist
        so don't get too worked up if you don't understand them.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># Set examples</span><br>
		  2. {<span class="red">'a'</span>, <span class="red">'b'</span>, <span class="red">'c'</span>}<br>
		  3. {<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>, <span class="green">3</span>}<br>
		  4. {<span class="green">1.1</span>, <span class="green">2.2</span>, <span class="green">3.3</span>}<br>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Like lists and tuples, sets can contain pretty much any data type that you want. You can make a set of all
        ints, all floats, or all strings. Also like lists and tuples, you can put multiple data types in a set, even
        other sets. Technically, sets use the same lookup algorithm as dictionaries, so they are more like
        dictionaries than lists and tuples, but the way they are used is more like that of lists and tuples. You
        can think of a set as a dictionary of all keys and no values.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>The type function</h3>
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">type</span>(<span class="red">"Hello"</span>)<br>
		  str<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">type</span>(<span class="green">2.8</span>)<br>
		  float<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">type</span>(<span class="green">5000</span>)<br>
		  int
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>At this point, I thought it useful to introduce you to the type function. You can pass any object to
        the type function and Python will return that object's type. All you have to do is put an object, or
        variable referencing an object, into the braces of the type function and the return value is the object's
        data type. Here are a few examples to make things more clear for you.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Getting Help</h3>

	  </div>
	  <p>Python has a few useful functions for getting help with object types. You pass objects to these functions,
        and be returned with a list of methods that work on the object. The two help functions that I use on a
        regular basis are <i>help</i> and <i>dir</i>. The syntax of these two functions are help(object) and dir(object).
        Help will return documentation on the object passed to it, and dir will return methods for the object passed to
        it. Do not worry too much about the syntax on lines seven and eight in the second example, I will cover this
        in the <i>list comprehension</i> tutorial. For now, just replace the object that you want to get the methods
        for in the dir function on these two lines. The first example shows a list of some of the most common object
        types in Python.
	  </p>

	  </div>
	  <p>Lines two and three will display documentation about the str object, and the dict object respectively.
        The help function displays user-friendly documentation about the object that is passed to it. Lines six
        and seven will display all methods that you can use on string objects. Line eight will display all methods
        that you can use on string objects as long as the method name does not start with an underscore "_".
        As I said earlier,  do not worry about the syntax on lines seven and eight; for now, just use it to get help
        on objects as you need!
