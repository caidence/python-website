	  <h3>The basics</h3>
	  <p>Math operators such as addition, subtraction, etc. (+, -, *, /). Work differently on different objects
        and in different contexts. Technically, these operators can do anything that you want, when you define
        your own classes, but we're not there yet. Succinctly put, classes have methods that you can change
		to change the functionality of the operator. This is called <i>operator overloading</i> and is a good
        example of polymorphism in Python.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>In this section, you will get some hands-on experience of how these math operators change depending on the
        context that they are used in. We will also explore how they work differently depending on the data types
        that we are using them on. Eventually, in the advanced tutorials, we will create classes where we can change
        the functionality of these operators by using user-defined methods. 
	  </p>
	</div>
    <div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Addition</h3>
	  <p>Addition works on numbers in Python as you would expect. The only thing to note about addition is if you
        add an int to a float, the object returned will be a float. This is true for all of Python's math
        operations where one data type is an int and the other is a float. The returned value will always be a float.
        Take a look at the examples for clarity.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="light-gray"># Adding an int to a float</span><br>
		  >>> <span class="green">1</span> <span class="purple">+</span> <span class="green">1.1</span><br>
		  2.1<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">1</span> <span class="purple">+</span> <span class="green">1.0</span><br>
		  1.0
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>The interesting thing about the addition operator is that we can use it on other data types. It is not
        just limited to ints and floats, we can also use it on tuples and lists. Once again, it probably works
        as expected. When you use + with lists and tuples, it simply adds the list or tuple to the end of the
        one that appears before the operator. Here are a few examples to make this more clear.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> [<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>] <span class="purple">+</span> 
		      [<span class="green">3</span>, <span class="green">4</span>]<br>
		  [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
		  >>> (<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>) <span class="purple">+</span> 
		      (<span class="green">3</span>, <span class="green">4</span>)<br>
		  (1, 2, 3, 4)
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>We start by adding two separate lists together. This essentially appends the second list to the end of
        the first. Remember, lists are mutable objects, which means that we can add to them. Next, we do the same
        thing with two tuples. Wait, if tuples are immutable, then how can we add two together? Well, we are not
        really adding the two tuples together at all. When we use the + operator on two tuples, Python creates a new
        tuple object with the combined contents of the tuples. Remember, math operators work differently in
        different contexts.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>We can also add two strings together. This is called <i>concatenation</i>. I covered this concept in the
         strings tutorial. Like tuples, strings are immutable. This means that we're not really adding strings
         together, but creating an entirely new string that contains the contents of both strings.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Subtraction</h3>
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">5</span> <span class="purple">-</span> <span class="green">4</span><br>
		  1<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">6.0</span> <span class="purple">-</span> <span class="green">1</span><br>
		  5.0<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">1</span> <span class="purple">-</span> <span class="green">2</span><br>
		  -1
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Subtraction only works on ints and floats and, once again, works much as you'd expect. Like addition, if
        one of the numbers is a float and the other is an int, Python will return a float. We subtract using the
        minus sign, of course.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Multiplication</h3>
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">5</span> <span class="purple">*</span> <span class="green">5</span><br>
		  25<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">1.5</span> <span class="purple">*</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  4.5<br>
          >>> [<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>] <span class="purple">*</span> <span class="green">2</span><br>
          [1, 2, 1, 2]<br>
          >>> (<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>) <span class="purple">*</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
          (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)<br>
          >>> <span class="red">"foo"</span> <span class="purple">*</span> <span class="green">4</span><br>
          'foofoofoofoo'
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Nothing too fancy with multiplication. We can multiply numbers using the asterisk character (*). Again,
        if you multiply an int and a float Python will return a float. Like with addition, and unlike with subtraction,
        multiplication will work on list, tuples, and strings. For these three data types, it essentially concatenates
        the object with itself however many times you multiply by. As you can see in the examples, all of the most
        rudimentary Python data type classes define a method for multiplication.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Division</h3>
	  <div class=" left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">25</span> <span class="purple">/</span> <span class="green">5</span><br>
		  5.0<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">1</span> <span class="purple">/</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  0.3333333333333333
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In Python, we can divide two numbers using a forward slash (/). Division is different than the other
        math operators, because no matter what numbers you divide, Python always will return a float.
        You can even divide an int by an int, and Python still will return a float.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Exponents</h3>
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">1</span> <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">10</span><br>
		  1<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">2</span> <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  8<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">10</span> <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">2</span><br>
		  100
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Python also makes exponents easy to use in math expressions. To get two to the power of three, for example,
        we would write 2 ** 3. This will return 2 to the power of 3. We use a double asterisk to define an exponent.
        Here are a few exponent examples.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Basically, how this works is Python takes the number on the right and multiplies it by itself as many times
        as the number on the left, which is technically the definition of exponents.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Floor Division</h3>
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">5</span> <span class="purple">//</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  1<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">11</span> <span class="purple">//</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  3
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In case you do not know, floor division is where you drop the decimal completely to get a whole number. Do
        not confuse floor division with rounding, because it is very different! For example, if you divide 11 by
        three, you get 3.6666. With floor division, you would not round this decimal up to make the answer 4,
        instead you would completely truncate the decimal to make the answer 3. We can achieve floor division by
        using double forward slash (//).
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>modulo</h3>
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">5</span> <span class="purple">%</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  2<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">6</span> <span class="purple">%</span> <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  0<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">10</span> <span class="purple">%</span> <span class="green">7</span><br>
		  3
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>This one is pretty abnormal, so bear with me. The modulo character will divide the two numbers and return
        the remainder from the division. For example, if you were to divide five by three; three goes into five one
        time and leaves a remainder of two. Because the remainder is two, that is what modulo will return. If there
        is no remainder then modulo will return zero. How we do this is just like dividing, but instead of a forward
        slash use the modulo operator (%). Just remember that modulo will return the remainder from division. How 
        is this useful? It is used mainly in data structures and algorithms. Oversimplified, if you want to get
        a random index of a list (Python sets and dictionaries use this in the background), you can have an
        algorithm that calculates a large number, and take the modulus of that large number by the length of the
        list. This algorithm will always return an index within the range of the list, because the remainder can
        never be greater than the length of the list.
