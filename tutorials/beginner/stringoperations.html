	  <h3>The Basics</h3>
	  <p>Before we go any further, you should probably know what a method is. Methods essentially add functionality
        to objects. You use methods by appending the method name to the end of an object with a period between the
        object and the method. To use a method on an object, you would write something like this Object.method_name().
        Notice how the object and the method are separated by a period. Also notice that after the method name 
		is a set of parentheses. This is called <i>calling</i> the method on the object. When using methods,
        you will almost always use the parentheses, but there are some special cases where you won't. Now that
        you know what a method does, let's look at some of the most common ones used on string objects. This tutorial
        will not cover all of the string methods, nor will I dive into great detail about the methods that I do
        cover. This tutorial is meant to demonstrate what a method is, some of the most common string methods, and
        their most common use cases.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>lower, upper</h3>
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> name = <span class="red">"Billy Bob"</span><br>
		  >>> lowercase_name = name.lower()</span><br>
		  >>> uppercase_name = name.upper()<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">print</span>(lowercase_name)<br>
		  billy bob<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">print</span>(uppercase_name)<br>
		  BILLY BOB
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>The lower and upper methods do exactly what they are named. The lower method converts all letters in a
        string to lowercase, and the upper method converts all letters in a string to uppercase. You will find these
        methods very useful when you are trying to make your programs more robust by validating user input. Let's
        have a look at the examples.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>We start off by creating a variable called <i>name</i> and setting it equal to the string "Billy Bob".
        We then create two new variables &ndash; <i>lowercase_name</i> and <i>uppercase_name</i>. We set
        <i>lowercase_name</i> equal to the variable <i>name</i> by using the lower method. This creates a new string,
		"billy bob", where all of the letters are lowercase. We then do the same thing on the next line, but with
        the upper method, which will convert all of the letters in the string to uppercase. Finally, we print the
        two new variables that we created demonstrating how they work. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>count, find, replace</h3>
	  <p>Before we move on, you need to know what a function argument is (methods are really just special functions,
        but we'll get to that later). Arguments are variables that are passed to a function that dictate what
	    the function will do or return. You pass arguments to functions within the parentheses following the function
        name. Functions can have many arguments, or none at all. Just remember, when I say <i>argument</i>, I am
        talking about the value that we pass to the function by putting it in the parentheses. If a function
		has more than one argument, we can separate them using a comma. What I just described looks something like
        this function(arg1, arg2, arg3).
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Side note, many of the methods we talk about in this tutorial do not only apply to strings, they can apply
        to other object types too, particularly sequence objects. The first method we will talk about is
        <i>count</i>, because it is the simplest to understand. The count method will count how many times a
        character or substring appears in a string. We use it like this string.count('character'). To be clear,
        <i>string</i> is what we are counting characters in, <i>count</i> is the method we are using on the
        string object, and <i>'character'</i> is what we are counting or how many times it appears in <i>string</i>.
        Here are some examples. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> string = <span class="red">"wow cow meow wow"</span><br>
		  >>> <span class="light-gray"># Count a single character</span><br>
		  >>> stringcount(<span class="red">'w'</span>)<br>
		  6<br>
		  >>> <span class="light-gray"># Count a substring</span><br>
		  >>> string.count(<span class="red">'wow'</span>)<br>
		  2
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Here we see that you can count either a single character or a substring. First, we use the count method
        on <i>string</i> to see how many times the letter 'w' appears in the string. The count method will return
        how many times the passed value appears in the object that you call it on, in this case, 6. Finally, we
        search for how many times that the word 'wow' appears in <i>string</i>. Next, let's talk about the <i>find</i>
        method.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Before we discuss <i>find</i>, you should be familiar with indexes (also called indices). An index is the
        numerical position that an element is at in an object. Indexes read from left to right and start at 0 by
        default. This is pretty confusing, so here is an example. Say we have a string <i>"example"</i>. Each
        character in the string has an index starting at 0 and counting from left to right. The <i>e</i> character
        is at index 0. The <i>x</i> character is at index 1. The <i>a</i> character is at index 2, and so on. Almost
        every object you work with in Python can be used with indexes. Many methods even return an index! The
        <i>find</i> method is a perfect example of a method that returns an index. The <i>find</i> method returns
        only one index, though. By default, find starts its search at the first index of the string, but you can
        change this by passing a second argument to the method &ndash; the second argument being the index to start
        searching at. For instance, if you wanted to start searching for the letter "a" from the 10<sup>th</sup>
        index on, you would write string.find("a", 9). The second argument being nine because the first index starts
        at 0.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> string = <span class="red">"coding is cool!"</span><br>
		  >>> string.find(<span class="red">'o'</span>)<br>
		  1<br>
		  >>> string.find(<span class="red">'o'</span>, <span class="green">2</span>)<br>
		  11<br>
		  >>> string.find(<span class="red">"?"</span>)<br>
		  -1
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In the first call to find, we search for the letter "o". Because we did not pass an index for where to
        begin the search, find will start the search for "o" at the 0<sup>th</sup> index. If there are more than
        one "o" characters in the string, find will only return the index of the first character match that it finds.
        In the second example, we pass 2 as a second argument to the find method. Because of the second argument,
		find will start its search at the 3<sup>rd</sup> index of the string. In the last example, we see that if
        the find method cannot find the character in the string, it will return -1.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Moving on to our last function for this subsection, <i>replace</i>. <i>replace</i> does exactly what its
        name implies &ndash; it replaces characters in a string with a new character. You need to pass at least two
        arguments to this method. The first item is the character in the string that you want to replace, and the
        second argument is the character that you want to replace the first argument with. The replace method will
        replace all of the characters in the string by default. You can pass a third optional argument to replace,
        the number of characters in the string you would like to replace. Say we have a string "Python is cool".
        We want to replace the o's with zeros. We would write something like this to accomplish that task,
        string.replace('o', '0').
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> string = <span class="red">"Python is cool"</span><br>
		  >>> string.replace(<span class="red">"o"</span>, <span class="red">"@"</span>)<br>
		  Pyth@n is c@@l<br>
		  >>> string.replace(<span class="red">"o"</span>, <span class="red">"@"</span>, <span class="green">1</span>)<br>
		  Pyth@n is cool
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>We can see when that we call the first replace method on the string, it replaces every "o" character with the "@" character. This is the default behavior 
	    of <i>replace</i>. We see how to change this default behavior when we call the <i>replace</i> method again with a third argument, 1. The third argument
		tells the replace method how many characters to replace. In our case, we set 1 as the third argument making the replace method only replace the first
		"o" in the string.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Index, Split</h3>
	  <p>Our last two string methods that we are going to talk about in this section are <i>index</i> and
        <i>split</i>. <i>index</i> will return the index of the first instance of the character passed to it.
        Index accepts a second optional argument, the index of the string to start the search at (much the same as
        <i>find</i>). With strings, the index and find methods can almost always be used interchangeably.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> string = <span class="red">"coding is cool!"</span><br>
		  >>> string.index(<span class="red">'o'</span>)<br>
		  1<br>
		  >>> string.index(<span class="red">'o'</span>, <span class="green">2</span>)<br>
		  11
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Here we see that <i>index</i> works basically the same as <i>find</i>. The only real difference when
         using <i>find</i> and <i>index</i> is: <i>find</i> will return -1 if it cannot find the character in the
         string, whereas <i>index</i> will raise a ValueError.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>The split method is very useful. <i>split</i> will take a string and turn it into a list of strings. It
        accepts an optional argument called a <i>delimiting</i> character. By default, <i>split</i> will turn each
        word in a string into a single list index because the default delimiting character is a space " ".
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> string = <span class="red">"split is preety neat!"</span><br>
		  >>> string.split()<br>
		  [<span class="red">'split'</span>, <span class="red">'is'</span>, <span class="red">'pretty'</span>, <span class="red">'neat!'</span>]<br>
		  >>> string = <span class="red">"commas, will split, this string"</span><br>
		  >>> string.split(<span class="red">','</span>)<br>
		  [<span class="red">'commas'</span>, <span class="red">'will split'</span>, <span class="red">'this string'</span>]
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In the first example, we see that the default behavior of <i>split</i> is to split every word in a string
        into a separate list item. Going on, we see that you can pass an argument to the method, which will act as a
        delimiting character to tell Python where you want the list split points at. In this example, we use a comma
        (,) as the delimiting character, telling Python to split the string and make a separate list index every time
        that there is a comma. Also note that the delimiting character will not appear in the strings in the list.
	  </p>
