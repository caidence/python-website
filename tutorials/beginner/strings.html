	  <h3>The basics</h3>
	  <p>In Python, there are many different data types. One of the most common
	    data types is called a string. Strings are used to store textual information
		such as your name or text stored in a file. A string is a good example of a 
		<i>sequence</i> which is a positional ordered collection of objects generally
		read from left to right. Strings are what we call <i>immutable</i> meaning
		that they cannot be changed in place. String operations create a new string,
		they never change the origional string. In Python, all objects are either immutable
		or mutable, but we'll get to this later.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># This is okay</span><br>
		  2. <span class="red">'This is a valid string in Python'</span><br>
		  3. <span class="red">"This is another valid string"</span><br>
		  4.<br>
		  5. <span class="light-gray"># This won't work</span><br>
		  6. <span class="red">'This is not a valid string"</span><br>
		  7. <span class="red">"Neither is this!'</span>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>We can create a string using either a pair of single quotation marks or double
	  quotation marks with text in-between. Everything between the pair of quotation marks will be
	  stored in the program as a string. It is important to note that you cannot
	  mix single and double quotes when making a string. The quotation marks must both
	  either be single or both be double but not one of each! The code example demonstrates 
	  valid and invalid strings.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Lines one and two in the example are both valid strings because
	    they do not mix and match single and double quotation marks. Nither line
		six or seven will work because
		the opening quotation mark is not the same as the closing quotation mark. What
		about lines one and five? Are these strings too? No, these lines are called comments.
		Comments are lines that are ignored by the program and are purely used for 
		documentation. Comments are usually used to describe a line of code and can
		be inline, single-line, or even multi-line (we'll get to multi-line comments
		in a later tutorial). Single and inline comments are declared using a pound symbol
		"#". Anything on the line typed after this character will be ignored by the program.
		Thats enough about comments for this tutorial. Now back to strings!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Escape Sequences</h3>
	  <p>There are certain characters that you cannot use in a string such as \
	    and quotation marks. If you created your string with single quotation marks
		you will not be able to put single quotation marks inside of it. Respectively
		you cannot put double quotation marks inside a string created with double 
		quotes.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="right code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># This is valid</span><br>
		  2. <span class="red">"The boy said 'hello everyone!'"</span><br>
		  3. <span class="red">'The boy said "hello everyone!"'</span><br>
		  4.<br>
		  5. <span class="light-gray"># Now with the escape character</span><br>
		  6. <span class="red">"The boy said \"Hello everyone!\""</span><br>
		  7. <span class="red">'The boy said \'Hello everyone\''</span><br>
		  8. <br>
		  9. <span class="light-gray"># Backslash in a string</span><br>
		  10. <span class="red">"\\ This is a single backslash"</span>
		</code>
      </div>
	  <p>Escape sequences allow us to put these characters inside of our strings.
	    For instance, if you wanted to put a single backslash in your string, you would 
		have to put two consecutive backslashes in your string "\\". Likewise, if you wish to put
		single quotes in a single quote string or double quotes in a double quote
		string, you would have to use the backslash escape character in front of the 
		quotation marks.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Lines two and three work because the quotation marks inside of the 
	    string are not the same as the quotation marks used to create the string.
		On lines six and seven we use the escape character (backslash "\") to get the quotation marks
		inside of the strings. We have to use the escape character because the quotation
		marks inside of the string are the same as those used to create the string. If you use the 
		string, the escape character will not show up in it. For example, if you pass one of the strings 
        to Python's built-in print function, the backslash will not appear in the output.
		Moving on, line ten is how you would put a single backslash inside of a string.
      </p>	  
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="light-gray"># Raw strings in action</span><br>
		  2. <span class="red">r"C:\windows\prefetch"</span><br>
		  3. <span class="red">R'C:\windows\prefetch'</span>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>A neat feature of Python 3 is something called a <i>raw string</i>. Raw strings
	    basically turn the escape character off so that you can use backslashes freely as
		you please in your strings. This is handy in many cases, for example, using a string
		as a file path to a location on your computer. We can create a raw string by placing
		an <i>r</i> right before the opening quote of our string (the <i>r</i> can be upper or
		lowecase). Lines two and three in this example do exactly the same thing.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Tabs and Newlines</h3>
	  <p>Now would be a good time to quickly introduce tab and newline characters.
	    With Python strings, there is an easy way to code tabs and newlines using the 
		escape character. If you want a newline in a string, you can use "\n" which is 
		the the <i>newline character</i>. Likewise, if you want to code a tab into a string, 
		you would use the <i>tab character</i> which is "\t". The examples demonstrate
		how to use these sequences in practice.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="right code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="red">"This string has \t a tab in the middle"</span><br>
		  2. <span class="red">"Line 1\nLine 2"</span>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In the example, the first line will have a tab in the middle of it if
	    it is printed or output to the console. The second line will display as 
		two separate lines with "Line 1" on the first line and "Line 2" on the second.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>print</h3>
	  <p>Before we go any further, I thought it would be important to introduce you to print().
	    In Python, print() is one way we can output data to the console. Anything between the
		braces () is what is output to the screen. For example, if you were to do something like
		print('Hello'). The program would print 'Hello' to the console. Here are a few examples of printing
		strings to the console. Side note, any line that starts with >>> in teh examples is a line of code, and any line 
		not prepended with >>> is console output. You will soon figure out that this is a common way to display programming
		examples.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="left code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"Hello world!"</span>)<br>
		  Hello world<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"Line 1\nLine 2"</span>)<br>
		  Line 1<br>
		  Line 2
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In the code, everything that appears between the () in the print statement
	    is output to the screen. You can see an example from earlier where we used the
		newline character (\n) to print a newline.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Basic String Operations</h3>
	  <div class="right code-example aniview" data-av-animation="slideInUp">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"Hello "</span> <span class="purple">+</span> <span class="red">"world!"</span>)<br>
		  Hello world!<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"foo"</span> <span class="purple">*</span> <span class="green">3</span>)<br>
		  foofoofoo<br>
		  >>> <span class="green">len</span>(<span class="red">'abc'</span>)<br>
		  3
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>There are a few common string operations that you should be aware of in Python.
	    You can add strings with a "+" (called <i>concatination</i>), multiply a string
		a finite number of times, and get the length of characters in a string using len() just to name
		a few. These operations are not specific just to strings. In fact, len is a <i>sequence function</i>
		meaning that it works on any data type that is considered a sequence in Python. Where as "+" and "*" are
        overloaded operators of the string class.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>In the first example, we use the "+" operator to essentally "add" two strings together. In programming
	    this is called concatination. Next, we see that you can multiply a string by a number, which basically just
		concatinates the string with itself as many times as the expression states. In the example, we multiplied
		'foo' times 3 which output 'foo' three times in a row: 'foofoofoo'. In the last example, we use len, which is
		short for length, to return the number of characters in the string between the braces (), in this case 'abc'.
	    These are just a few of the most basic operations that you can use on strings. There are many more in the tutorials
	    to come!
