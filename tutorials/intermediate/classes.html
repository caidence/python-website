	  <h3>The basics</h3>
	  <p>If you have read any of the previous tutorials, you've probably seen me use the word "object" to refer to different data types. Really, every
	    object type is a class and datatype just refers to what kind of object something is. We have really been using classes all along! 
		Simply put, a class is a coding structure used to implement our own custom objects. Classes are
		part of what we call <i>object-oriented programming</i> (OOP). OOP is a more effective way to code because it is reusable and reduces
		code redundancy. It allows us to define our own objects which we can create our own methods for. Classes are essentially a template
		to create your own objects that also defines how our program can interact with the objects that we create.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>OOP is a form of programming that focuses on using objects to design a program. An object is a component of programming that preforms
	    specific actions (based on the programming language) and interacts with other parts of a program. Classes allow us an easy way to structure
		our code in a way that makes more logical sense to us as humans. The behavior of objects is determined by methods which are subroutines that have 
		the ability to operate on and manipulate objects and classes. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Why Classes?</h3>
	  <p>Classes are an easy way to structure real objects in the real world around us. There are many advantages to using OOP over functional
	    programming. With using OOP, you can optimize code organization. OOP defines standard ways to easily organize data and procedures in
		your code. If you use OOP smartly, it will help yourself and others more easily understand what is happening in your code. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Building off of organization, another advantage of OOP is encapsulation. By encapsulation,
	    I am referring to how data is conveniently stored alongside the methods that create and manipulate it. This makes it easy to hide code from the
		public interface. If we want, we can easily change this hidden code without changing the interface on the public side of the program.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Probably one of the most notable advantages of OOP is inheritance. This is a feature of OOP that allows us to easily build off of code 
	    that we have already written. It lets us define data in one place, use it and, or override it in another place if need be. It allows us to
		extend our own code, or even built-in code. Inheritance makes our programs easily scalable.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>OOP makes coding easier on the programmer because it is very flexible and offers great reusability. We are able to "borrow" code from
	    other classes that we have created and use that code in new classes. We are also able to import classes that
		we write into other programs so that we can use the objects that our classes define in the new code.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Of course, these are not all of the advantages of using OOP. It is a really good idea to start using an OOP approach for your programs. OOP
	    is a pretty ubiquitous concept and is standard in all major programming languages. OOP reduces code maintenance overhead and is probably the
		most popular paradigm that programmers use today.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
	  <p>Starting off, it is important that you understand the difference between an <i>instance</i> and a <i>class</i>. Classes act as a blueprint
	    for default behavior of instances. You can think of a class as a factory for instances. Instance objects are the objects that your program
		processes. Every time that you call a class, you will create a new instance of that class. There can exist more than one instance from the 
		same class in a program at the same time and each instance can have its own data. Just remember, classes are templates to create instances
		and instances are the objects in a program that we interact with.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Here is a class on the most basic level. We define a class by using the <i>class</i> keyword followed by the name of the class. <i>x</i>
	    and <i>y</i> are called <i>class variables</i>. These two variables will be the same for all instances of the class we create unless
		we explicitly change them change them. If we change either of these variables in the class, it will change the variable in each instance of the class.
		However, if we change these variables from an instance, it will not change the variables in the other instances. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Example</span>:<br>
		  ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x = <span class="green">10</span><br>
		  ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y = <span class="green">3</span><br>
		  >>><br>
		  >>> instance_one = Example()<br>
		  >>> instance_two = Example()
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Here, we create a class called <i>Example</i> which has two class variables -- x, and y. x and y will be the same value for each instance
	    that we create of the class. As you can see, we create instances with the format: instance_name = class_name( ). <i>instance_one</i>
		and <i>instance_two</i> are completely separate objects. If we manipulate one, it will not manipulate the other. Instead of saing that the 
		object type of <i>instance_one</i> and <i>instance_two</i> is string, or tuple, or list; we say that the object type of <i>instance_one</i>
		and <i>instance_two</i> is <i>Example</i>. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>To access the variables of our objects, we use the syntax: instance_name.variable_name. We can change the class variables 
	    for all classes by using the syntax: class_name.variable = new_value. By using this syntax, we effectively change the 
		value of the class variable for every instance of the class. Building off of the example from earlier, here is how to access variables from
		the instance, as well as change the class variables for all instances.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> instance_one.x<br>
		  10<br>
		  >>> instance_two.x<br>
		  10<br>
		  >>> Example.x = <span class="green">5</span><br>
		  >>> instance_one.x<br>
		  5<br>
		  >>> instance_two.x<br>
		  5<br>
		  >>> instance_two.z = <span class="green">6</span><br>
		  >>> instance_two.z<br>
		  6<br>
		  >>> instance_one.y = <span class="green">45</span></br>
		  >>> instance_one.y<br>
		  45<br>
		  >>> instance_two.y<br>
		  3
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>There is a lot of important information here so let's break it down. On the first and third lines, we access the class variable <i>x</i>
	    by typing the instance name appended with a period followed by the variable name. In the class <i>Example</i>, the class variable <i>x</i> is 10,
		thus, every instance created from the <i>Example</i> class will have a variable <i>x</i> which equals 10. The same applies for the class 
		variable <i>y</i>. After we see that each instance has a variable <i>x</i>, we write "Example.x = 5". Remember, <i>Example</i> is the name
		of our class, meaning that this statement will change the value of the variable <i>x</i> in every instance of the class to 5. We see this
		by viewing the value of the x variable of instance_one and instance_two. Next, we set the variable <i>z</i> of instance_two to equal
		6. But wait, <i>Example</i> does not have a class variable named <i>z</i>, so how is this possible? This is completely legal in Python.
		This line will create a variable named <i>z</i> in instance_two, but not instance_one. Please don't do this, more often than not, there is a better
		way to write your classes than to create variables this way. Finally, we change the value of <i>y</i> in instance_one. When we now view the
		value stored at <i>y</i> for both instances, we see that its value in instance_one is now 45, but it did not change the value of it in
		instance_two.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container"> 
	  <p>This is how classes work on the most basic level. There is a lot more ot OOP than assigning variables to objects. We will take a deeper
	    dive into some of the more useful aspects of OOP in later tutorials. This tutorial was just created to briefly introduce you to what we 
		will be working with for many of the tutorials to come.
