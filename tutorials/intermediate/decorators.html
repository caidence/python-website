	  <h3>The Basics</h3>
	  <p>In layman's terms, decorators are functions that accept other functions as arguments. They then modify how the function passed to it works
	    and returns a callable object which will call the original function along with the added functionality. They do this by wrapping a "wrapper"
		function within another function. We'll call these two functions <i>outer</i> and <i>inner</i>. Outer accepts a function as an argument, 
		calls that function within inner along with other modifications, and returns inner without calling it.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>There are many ways that we can write decorators. In this tutorial, we will focus on three of the simplest. First, I want to show you
	    how decorators work without using the @ syntax so you really get a feel for what is going on behind the scenes. Next, we will walk through
		using decorator functions with the @ syntax. Finally, we will look at how to turn decorator functions in to decorator classes.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Simple decorator</h3>
	  <p>Before we go any further, I thought it would be useful to introduce you to the syntax of a decorator function. To demonstrate how they
	    really work, let's create a very basic decorator function and a very basic function to test it on.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">decorator</span>(function):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">wrapper</span>():<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'Before the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function()<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'After the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">return</span> wrapper<br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">test</span>():<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'This is a test'</span>)<br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> dec_test = decorator(test)<br>
	      >>> dec_test()<br>
	      Before the function runs<br>
          This is a test<br>
          After the function runs
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Just so we are on the same page: <i>decorator</i> is the decorator function in this example and <i>test</i> is the function that we will be
	    passing to decorator. First, let's look at decorator. It accepts a function as an argument and has a nested function within it called <i>wrapper</i>.
		This wrapper function is where the magic happens. Within wrapper, we modify how the function runs that we passed as an argument to decorator,
		then decorator will return wrapper without calling it. That is important, so I'll say it again. The decorator function returns the wrapper
		function without calling it. Let's walk through what is happening in this code.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>We declare a function called decorator that accepts one argument, a function. Within the outer decorator function, there is another function
	    called wrapper. Within wrapper, there are two print statements. These statements will run before and after the function call. Between the
		two print statements, we call the function passed to decorator. After the wrapper function, decorator will return wrapper with the function
		passed to decorator, without calling the wrapper function.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>After the decorator function, we create a function to pass to decorator as an argument called <i>test</i>. Side note, our decorator function
	    does not have to be called <i>decorator</i>, its name is arbitrary. The reason that I called it this is to clarify which function is actually
		the decorator function. Back to the example, all that test will do when it is called is print "This is a test". The next few lines are what is
		important and make our decorator function work the way it is supposed to. dec_test = decorator(test), creates a variable called dec_test, and
		passes the test function to the decorator function. The reason that we do not need to pass test to the decorator with parentheses is because
		we do not want to call it yet. Passing it as an argument without parentheses means that it will only be called from within the decorator function.
		On the next line, we can see that we are able to call dec_test just like any other function. When we call dec_test, it is really calling the
		wrapper function within decorator. This works because wrapper was returned without being called and set equal to the dec_test variable. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>@decorator</h3>
	  <p>Now that we know how decorators work behind the scenes, let's recreate the same example, but by using the @ syntax. When we use this syntax,
	    basically, what is happening is Python creates a variable that has the same name as the function and sets it equal to decorator(function).
		To visualize this with the last example, that line would look like this: test = decorator(test). So now when we call test, it will call
		the decorator and pass test to it.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">decorator</span>(function):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">wrapper</span>():<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'Before the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function()<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'After the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">return</span> wrapper<br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> <span class="purple">@decorator</span><br>
          ... <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">test</span>():<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'This is a test'</span>)<br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> test()<br>
		  Before the function runs<br>
		  This is a test<br>
		  After the function runs
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>This example works exactly the same as the last. The difference is how we pass the test function to the decorator function. In the last
	    example, we did it manually by writing: dec_test = decorator(test). This example, we do it by decorating test. This is done by typing an
		@ symbol, appended with the decorator function, directly above the function that you want to decorate. By using this syntax, Python will 
		automatically pass <i>test</i> to <i>decorator</i> for us whenever we directly call <i>test</i>. Now that's all fine and dandy, but what
		if we want to pass arguments to the functions that we decorate? Well, that is another great use for *args and **kwargs!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>This may seem a little strange, but we actually pass *args and **kwargs to the wrapper function, not the decorator function. If you think about
	    it, it makes sense. When we run decorator, it will return the wrapper function, so if we pass the function arguments (of the function that we
		want to decorate) to wrapper, then wrapper can directly pass them to the function when it calls it.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">decorator</span>(function):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">wrapper</span>(<span class="purple">*</span>args,
 		      <span class="purple">**</span>kwargs):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'Before the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function(<span class="purple">*</span>args, <span class="purple">**</span>kwargs)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'After the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">return</span> wrapper<br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> <span class="purple">@decorator</span><br>
          ... <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">test</span>(message):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(message)<br>
	      >>> <br>
	      >>> test(<span class="red">'Now we can use arguments!'</span>)<br>
	      Before the function runs<br>
          Now we can use arguments!<br>
          After the function runs
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>This example functions the same as the last. The difference is: the function <i>test</i> in this example accepts an argument called message.
	    Instead of it printing "This is a test" every time it is called, now it will print the message argument that is passed to it. In order to
		make the decorator function pass arguments to the function that we are decorating, we need a way of passing the arguments to the function
		within the decorator. This is where we use *args and **kwargs. When we pass these as arguments to the wrapper function, wrapper can pass the
		arguments directly to the function that is passed to decorator. Now we are able to pass arguments to the decorator and still get the full 
		functionality of test.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Decorator as a class</h3>
	  <p>Some programmers like to write decorators as a class rather than a function. This (in my opinion) is a lot cleaner than having a nasty 
	    decorator function. To demonstrate this, let's use the same example that we have been using, but turn decorator in to a class rather than 
		a function. To make this work, the wrapper function has a special method called __call__. The class name will be decorator and all of 
		the functionality that we will get from the decorator class will be wrapped in the __call__ method. We use __call__ so that the @ syntax will
		still work the same as it does in the previous examples.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Decorator</span>:<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__init__</span>(self, function):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.function = function<br>
          ...<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__call__</span>(self, <span class="purple">*</span>args,
		      <span class="purple">**</span>kwargs):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'Before the function runs'</span>)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.function(<span class="purple">*</span>args, <span class="purple">**</span>kwargs)<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">'After the function runs'</span>)<br>
		  >>><br>
		  >>> <span class="purple">@Decorator</span><br>
          ... <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">test</span>(message):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(message)<br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> test(<span class="red">'It works as a class too!'</span>)<br>
		  Before the function runs<br>
		  It works as a class too!<br>
		  After the function runs
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>This example works the same as the last few. Instead of using a decorator function, we create a Decorator class. The init method accepts
	    the function that we want to decorate as an argument. In the Decorator class, the wrapper function is replaced with the __call__ method.
		Like with wrapper, we want to pass *args and **kwargs to __call__ so that it can pass them to self.function. Remember, self.function is &ndash;
		in this case &ndash; referring to the <i>test</i> function. As you can see, the @ syntax works exactly the same when decorating the <i>test</i>
		function. We just use @ appended with the name of the decorator class to decorate a function. This works because the @ operator can be
		overloaded by using the __call__ magic method. As you can see, now when we call test, the decorator class works just as it did in the previous
		examples.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Timer class</h3>
	  <p>Decorators are one of Python's more abstract concepts, so I thought that I would show a more practical example. This example will still be simple,
	    but will make more sense to use over the previous examples. Let's create a decorator class that can benchmark how fast our functions
		run. This may seem silly, but if/when you start caring about algorithms, this will be much more useful to you. This is not the only thing
		that decorators can be used for, but it is one of the simplest use cases. Some other ways that we can use decorators include, but are
		not limited to: meta programming, benchmarking, logging, and type checking. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example fun-example">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Timer</span>:<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__init__</span>(self, function):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.function = function<br>
          ...<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__call__</span>(self, <span class="purple">*</span>args,
		      <span class="purple">**</span>kwargs):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">import</span> time<br>

          ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="green">return</span> template.format(self.function.__name__,
		     end <span class="purple">-</span> start)<br>

		  >>> <span class="purple">@Timer</span><br>

          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">for</span> x <span class="green">in range</span>(<span class="green">2</span>, num):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">if</span> num <span class="purple">%</span> x 
		      <span class="purple">==</span> <span class="green">0</span>:<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">return False</span><br>
          ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="green">return True</span><br>
	      >>><br>
	      >>> is_prime(<span class="green">9918199</span>)<br>
	      'is_prime took 1.4397 seconds to execute'
		</code>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Here we create a class called Timer. The purpose of this class is to use it as a decorator so that we can easily time how long functions
	    take to execute. This is incredibly useful when benchmarking code. This method of benchmarking makes it so where we only have to
		write one extra line of code to time functions: @Timer. Timer works the same as the Decorator class in the last example. Timer, however, 
		will time how long a function takes rather than print statements before and after the function.
