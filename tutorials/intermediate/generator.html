	  <h3>The Basics</h3>
	  <p>Generator functions look and work much like regular functions. The difference is, generators are a simple way of creating an iterator. Because
	    generators do not construct a result all
		at once, they drastically improve the use of memory by a program, but usually at the cost of slower runtime. Generators do not return the
		entirety of a result all at once, because of this, they save their state and 
		retain information such as variables and scope between results. The main difference between a generator and a function is that a generator <i>
		yields</i> a value rather than returning one. The yield statement will suspend the state of the function and return a value back to the caller,
		but retains the state of the function so that it can resume later from where it left off. When the generator is resumed, it will pick up where
		it left off from the last yield run. Simply put, a generator is a function that returns an object that we can iterate over one value at a time.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Yield</h3>
	  <p>It can be hard to comprehend at first, but it is pretty simple if you just stop and think about it. The yield keyword acts like return, but it will
	    return a value, pause the function and retain its state, and continue where it left off on successive calls. There can be more than one
		yield keyword in a generator, there can even be a return keyword in a generator function, but as long as there is at least one yield keyword, 
		Python will interpret it as a generator function.

		  '5 + 3 = 8'
		</code>

	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>In the example above, we create a generator function called <i>generator</i>. There are three <i>yield</i> statements within this function. 
	    After the function, we create a generator object called <i>test</i> by setting <i>test</i> equal to a function call to the generator. A simple way
	    iterate over generators is by using the <i>next</i> function on the generator object. Yield will return a value and control to the caller and the next
		time that we call <i>next</i> on the generator object, the function will continue where it left off. The first yield statement in this example will print the number
		passed to the function plus one. If the function is called with <i>next</i>, only the first yield statement will execute. If <i>next</i> is called
		on the object a second time, the second yield statement will execute. If <i>next</i> is called on the object a third time, the third yield statement
		will execute. In the case of this function, if <i>next</i> is called on the object a fourth time, Python will raise a StopIteration exception. This
		because after the third yield statement, there is no more function to continue to.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Because generator functions are iterators, we can treat them as iterable objects. A common scheme in Python is using the values returned by a 
	    generator by using a for loop. Each time that the loop is executed, the generator object will <i>generate</i> a new value. The main advantage
		of generators is that they do not load an entire object to memory at once, they wait until we tell them to generate portions of the object.
		This saves memory space in programs, but is a bit slower because the generator has to generate a new value when we iterate over it. This means that
		the generator code executes with every iteration.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">squares</span>(array):<br>
		  ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">for</span> number <span class="green">in</span> array:<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">yield</span> number <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">2</span><br>
		  >>> <span class="green">for</span> i <span class="green">in</span> squares(<span class="green">range</span>(<span class="green">5</span>)):<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(i, end=<span class="red">" : "</span>)<br>
		  0 : 1 : 4 : 9 : 16 : 
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>On the first line we create a generator function called <i>squares</i>. This generator function accepts a list of numbers and will square the values
	    in the list. Since the <i>yield</i> keyword is in the for loop, the function will stop every time the for loop executes. This means that if we call
		<i>next</i> on the generator object that we create, only one value will be returned at a time. When we use a for loop on a generator object, next()
		is called automatically. We can see this with the for loop after the function. In this loop, we create a generator object to iterate over by 
		making a call to the function and passing a range of numbers. Since, <i>next</i> is called automatically with for loops, the loop will print out
		all of the results from the generator object until we exhaust the object. Because we are using a generator function, the code within the generator
		is actually called with every iteration of the for loop.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>A Deeper Look</h3>
	  <p>If you remember nothing else from reading this page, remember this: generator functions are functions that behave like an iterator. I have talked
	    about iterators a lot, but what are they? In Python, an iterator is defined by a class that uses the <i>iterator protocol</i>. This protocol will 
		look for two methods within a class: __iter__ and __next__. The reason that we use iterators is mostly to save time and space in our programs. Every
		object that we use in Python is actually a class. These classes either support the iterator protocol, or don't. Generators are iterators. This is why
		we are able to iterate over a function call to a generator function, because the call will actually create a generator object. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Once again, generators do not load an object completely into memory, they just create a way to generate pieces of information as needed. To demonstrate
	    this, I am going to compare a list object and a generator object. Say we have a normal function <i>cubed</i>. This function accepts a list of numbers
		as an argument and creates a new list that contains the cubed values of the numbers in the argument list. If we pass a list to this function, it will
		create the new list of the cubed values and store it into memory so that we can access it later and use it as we please. Now let's say that we turn
		this function into a generator. If we do so and pass the same argument list, our program would not create a new results list, instead, it would create
		a generator object. Keep in mind that we can iterate over generator objects the same way that we can with lists. The difference between our generator
		object and the list is, the generator object does not immediately call the function for every item in the argument list like the normal function does.
		This means that the generator object takes up less space than the list object created by the normal function. The generator object will not execute
		the function code until we decide that we want to use it.

		  >>> cubed_gen(test)<br>
		  &lt;generator object cubed at 0x000002256A05DD00>
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>There is a lot going on here, so let's break it down. On the first line of code, we create a list called <i>test</i>. This is the list object
	    we are going to pass to both functions to compare how they run. On the third line of code, we create a function called <i>cubed</i>. THIS IS NOT
		A GENERATOR FUNCTION. I created this function in order to compare its output to a generator function. The <i>cubed</i> function accepts a list aside
		an argument and will create a new list containing cubed values of the items in the argument list. It is important to recognize that this function
		creates a list object and returns the entire object all at once because this is the difference between traditional and generator functions. When we 
		call this function, the code runs and the new list object is returned all at once. Proceeding this output, we create a generator function that achieves 
		similar results. Notice, when we call <i>cubed_gen</i>, we do not get back a results list, instead, we get back a generator object. This is because
		the code within the generator function has not run yet on the list that we passed to it as an argument. The code will only run if we iterate over the generator
		object. This has the advantage of saving memory space because we do not have to load the list object into memory. Remember, now if we iterate over
		this generator object, the code within the generator function is run for every item in the list passed to the generator function at the time that
		we iterate over the object.
