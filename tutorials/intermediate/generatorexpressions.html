	  <h3>The Syntax</h3>
	  <p>Generator expressions are somewhere between a generator function and a list comprehension. A generator has the functionality of a generator
	    object with the syntax of a list comprehension. The only difference in syntax between generator expressions and list comprehensions is with
		generator expressions, you wrap with ( ) rather than [ ]. Generator expressions support for loop nesting and if statements. Like generator
		functions, generator expressions create a generator object that we can iterate over in our program. One call thing about generator expressions
		is, because they are wrapped in ( ), we do not need to wrap them in parentheses in function calls.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>The functionality of generator expressions is exactly the same as generator functions. Because I covered what generators actually do in the
	    previous tutorial, I will not discuss much how generators work on this page. This tutorial assumes you have read the previous one and is
		aimed at generator expression syntax rather than what the generator is actually doing behind the scenes.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>The Basics</h3>
	  <p>As mentioned earlier, generator expressions create generator objects just like generator functions. The difference is, generator expressions can
	    be coded on one line like list comprehensions. Let's take a look at a few examples where I demonstrate a generator function and create
		a generator expression that is equivalent to the function.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  1. test_list = [<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>, <span class="green">3</span>,
		     <span class="green">4</span>]<br>
		  2. <br>
		  3. <span class="light-gray"># Generator function</span><br>
		  4. <span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">gen_squares</span>(array):<br>
		  5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">for</span> num <span class="green">in</span> array:<br>
		  6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">yield</span> num <span class="purple">**</span> 
		     <span class="green">2</span><br>
		  7. example = gen_squares(test_list)<br>
		  8. <br>
		  9. <span class="light-gray"># Generator expression</span><br>
		  10 example = (num <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">2 for</span> num <span class="green">in</span> test_list)
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Lines 7 and 10 achieve the exact same result. The difference is, line 7 creates a generator object by calling a generator function where as 
	    line 10 is a generator expression. As you can see, generator expressions have the same syntax as list comprehensions with the difference being
		that the expression is wrapped in ( ) rather than [ ]. Because generator expressions create generator objects just like generator functions,
		we can iterate over generator expressions too. We can even replace where we would normally place a variable in our code with a generator
		expression if we want. A way of doing this is by replacing variable names in for loops with a generator expression.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> <span class="green">for</span> x <span class="green">in</span> (x <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">2 for</span>
		      x <span class="green">in range</span>(<span class="green">4</span>)):<br>
		  ... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(x, end=<span class="red">' - '</span>)<br>
		  0 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>More often than not, we put a variable referencing an object in the for loop header: for x in <i>variable</i>:. In this example, we see
	    that we can replace where we would usually put a variable with a generator expression. This works because a generator expression creates
		a generator object. Remember, generator objects are iterators so when we put a generator object directly in the header of a for loop, the
		loop will automatically iterate over the generator object created by the expression.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Nested Generators</h3>
	  <p>Believe it or not, we have been working with generators in many of the previous tutorials. Python's range built in function actually returns
	    a generator object. This is why we can get away with putting massive numbers in a function call to range. Any time that we use range
		in a generator we are actually nesting a generator within a generator. Nesting generators has the advantage of saving memory. This is because
		they will execute without creating multiple lists that would need to be stored in memory.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example fun-example">
	   <code>
	      >>> <span class="light-gray"># Nested list comprehension</span><br>
		  >>> [x <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">2 for</span> x <span class="green">in</span>
		      [x <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">3 for</span> x <span class="green">in</span>
			  (<span class="green">1</span>, <span class="green">2</span>, <span class="green">3</span>, <span class="green">4</span>)]]<br>
		  [1, 64, 729, 4096]<br>
		  >>><br>
		  >>> <span class="light-gray"># Nested generator expression</span><br>
		  >>> <span class="green">list</span>(x <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">2 for</span> x <span class="greem">in</span>
		      (x <span class="purple">**</span> <span class="green">3 for</span> x <span class="green">in</span> (<span class="green">1</span>,
			  <span class="green">2</span>, <span class="green">3</span>, <span class="green">4</span>)))<br>
		  [1, 64, 729, 4096]
	   </code>
	  </div>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Both the nested list comprehension and the nested generator expression have the same effect. Both also have advantages and disadvantages.
	    Let's start with the list comprehension. The major advantage of the list comprehension is its speed. List comprehensions are faster than
		generator expressions because the list is loaded into memory before the computation begins on the object. The main disadvantage of list
		comprehensions is; they take up a lot more memory. This is because the entire list object is loaded into memory before the program can
		execute tasks on the list. This is fine for small lists, but becomes a major disadvantage for large list objects. Generators pretty much have
		the inverse advantages and disadvantages of list comprehensions. An advantage of generator expressions is; they consume much less memory. This
		is because as we iterate through a generator object, each element of the object is only loaded into memory as needed. The entire object is 
		not loaded all at once. A disadvantage of generator functions, as you can probably guess by this point, are slower to iterate over than the 
		list object created by comprehensions. This is because the expression actually has to execute with each iteration of the generator object.
