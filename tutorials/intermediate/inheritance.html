	  <h3>The basics</h3>
	  <p>Inheritance is probably one of the most notable features of OOP. It allows us to build new classes that take code from classes that we have
	    already made. Inheritance makes programs more flexible, versatile, and expandable. With inheritance, we can create base classes, which will
		act as a common functionality for all future classes. If we program this way, we will not have to write the same method in more than on class
		because the method can just be inherited if we want!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Generally, when a class inherits from another, it will acquire all properties and methods of the parent class. This is what I mean when I
	    say that OOP is a way to create classes from existing classes. We have really been using inheritance all along believe it or not. Every
		class that we create actually inherits from a class called <i>object</i>. This is the base class that all objects in Python inherit from.
		Writing: class Test: is the same as writing class Test(object):. This is the syntax used for inheritance in Python, as you'll see very soon!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
	  <p>When one class inherits from another, it will acquire most of the methods from the class that it inherits from. A few of the methods that
	    are not inherited are constructors, destructors, and Python's __init__. To mitigate a child class not calling its parent's __init__ method,
		we can call the parent's __init__ method explicitly from the child's __init__ method. Let's look at an example to show how this works, as well
		as how a child inherits methods from its parent class.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Parent</span>:<br>
          2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__init__</span>(self, x=<span class="green">0</span>,
		     y=<span class="green">0</span>):<br>
          3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.x = x<br>
          4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.y = y<br>
          5. <br>
          6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">do_stuff</span>(self):<br>
          7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total = <span class="green">0</span><br>
          8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">for</span> v <span class="green">in</span> 
		     self.__dict__.values():<br>
          9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;total <span class="purple">+=</span> v<br>
          10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">return</span> total<br>
		  11. <br>
		  12. <br>
		  13. <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Child</span>(Parent):<br>
          14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__init__</span>(self, x=<span class="green">0</span>,
		      y=<span class="green">0</span>, z=<span class="green">0</span>):<br>
          15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent.__init__(self, x, y)<br>
          16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.z = z
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>The Parent class accepts two arguments: x and y. Parent also has a method: <i>do_stuff</i> that will add all of the instance variables
	    together and return the total. There is also a class called <i>Child</i> which inherits from Parent. To make Child inherit from Parent, we 
        have to put Parent in the parentheses following the Child class definition like this: class Child(Parent):. Because Child inherits from
        Parent, we will also be able to call the <i>do_stuff</i> method from an instance of Child. A key point to notice is the __init__ method in
        Child. Because Child accepts some of the same arguments as Parent, we want to use the __init__ method in Parent for those arguments. We do_stuff
        this by explicitly calling the Parent's __init__ in the Child's __init__ method and passing the similar vales to the explicitly called parent
		__init__. For instance, in the example, both Chile and Parent accept the arguments <i>x</i> and <i>t</i>. Because these arguments are the same
        in both classes, we want to initialize these two arguments by using the __init__ method in Parent. To do this, we can write: 
		Parent.__init__(self, x, y). This will initialize the variables with the Parent's __init__, but we can still treat them as a part of the
        Child instance, because they are. We can still access these variables from child instances by writing: child)instance.x, or; child_instance.y. 		
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>If we create an instance of Child, we can do everything that is defined in the Parent class. The difference between Parent and Child is that,
	    Child has a third instance variable &ndash; z. You can think of Child as an extension of Parent. Child will act the same as parent, but it has
		another instance variable.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> test = Child(x=<span class="green">1</span>, y=<span class="green">2</span>, z=<span class="green">3</span>)<br>
		  >>> test.x<br>
		  1<br>
		  >>> test.y<br>
		  2<br>
		  >>> test.z<br>
		  3<br>
		  >>> test.do_stuff()<br>
		  6
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>First, we create an instance of Child called <i>test</i>. As you can see, we can access the x, y, and z instance variables of instances
	    of Child just like we can with instances of Parent (excluding z). Since Parent does not have an instance variable called z, we have to
		explicitly set it in the initialization method of Child. However, if we can, we want to initialize Child classes with their Parent's
		initialization functions. Even though we did not explicitly create a do_stuff function in the Child class, we can still call it on child
		instances because it is inherited from the Parent class.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>Super()</h3>
	  <p>There is, however, an alternative to explicitly calling methods from the parent class by their name. We can use the <i>super()</i> function
	    to do this for us. We use the syntax: super().method_name(), to call the parent's method that is named <i>method_name</i>. The advantage
		of using super over explicitly writing the name of the method in the Parent function is: it eliminates the need to declare certain characteristics
		of a class. If a class inherits from more than one other
		class and, for instance, needs to initialize variables that are inherited from each parent class, super will call the __inti__ method from each
		parent class in one statement rather than having to call each parents' __init__ explicitly.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>When you can, you will want to use super in place of directly calling methods from the Parent class. It will reduce maintenance overhead,
	    improve readability, and reduce code redundancy. For instance, in the last example, we had the opportunity to use super. In the __init__
		method of Child, because Child and Parent have two of the same instance variables -- x and y. We could call super instead of explicitly
		calling __init__ from Parent. Here is a look at what the before and after Child class would look like.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		1. <span class="light-gray"># Without using super()</span><br>
		2. <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Child</span>(Parent):<br>
        3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__init__</span>(self, x=<span class="green">0</span>,
		   y=<span class="green">0</span>, z=<span class="green">0</span>):<br>
        4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parent.__init__(self, x, y)<br>
        5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.z = z<br>
		6.<br>
		7. <span class="light-gray"># With using super()</span><br>
		8. <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Child</span>(Parent):<br>
        9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">__init__</span>(self, x=<span class="green">0</span>,
		   y=<span class="green">0</span>, z=<span class="green">0</span>):<br>
        10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">super</span>().__init__(x, y)<br>
        11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self.z = z
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>These two definitions of Child will work exactly the same. The difference is -- one calls the Parent __init__ method explicitly
        by using the name of the Parent class (Parent.__init__(self, x, y)), and one calls the Parent __init__ method by using super() 
		(super().__init__(x, y)). Notice how when we use super to call the parent's initialization method, that we do not have to pass 
        <i>self</i> as the first argument to __init__. We do, however, have to pass <i>self</i> when we write: Parent.__initn__(self, x, y).
        Python's super function is smart enough to where we can exclude the self argument and it will still work the same as calling the parent __init__ by
		name with the self argument.
	  </p>
    </div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>We're all people; right?</h3>
	  <p>I wanted to take the opportunity to look at a slightly more sophisticated and larger example of a program that uses inheritance.
	    A simple way to demonstrate this is by using people. We all have different relationships with different people. For instance, we all have
		friends, family, co-workers, classmates, etc. Even though our relationship is different between each person, they're all still people. This
		makes for an excellent example to use inheritance. All people, despite their relation to us, have many of the same attributes such as a first
		name, last name, and age. We can use these common attributes to create a base class, Person. The relationship that we have with each person
		will all have these attributes in our base class. We can then create a subclass that inherits from Person for people who have different
		types relationships with us. For instance, Employee, Friend, and Family. These classes can each have their own unique attributes and methods,
		but still have the same attributes and methods as our base Person class.

	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>There is a ton of code here, so let's take it line-by-line. On the first line, we create a class called Person. This is going to be our
	    base class that all other classes will inherit from. This class defines instance variables called first_name and last_name. All other
		classes will have these variables as well and will set them by calling the __init__ method from Person. In Person, there is also a method
		called <i>full_name</i>. This will return the full name of the person and will work on instances created from any class.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>The next class is called <i>Coworker</i> and inherits from <i>Parent</i>. Because of this, we are able to call the <i>full_name</i> method
	    from instances that we create of Coworker. Notice the initialization method in Coworker. Because, first_name and last_name instance variables
		are required for both Coworker and Person, we want to initialize those variables with the Person __init__ method. We do this by directly
		passing the variables from the init method in Coworker to the super().__init__() method. Coworker extends Person. The difference is, Coworker
        accepts an  additional argument &ndash; a salary. There is also an additional method in Coworker. <i>give_raise</i> will raise the salary by 2%.		
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>The third class is called <i>Friend</i>. Friends are also people (believe it or not) and that iw why the Friend class inherits from Person. 
	    Because Friend inherits from Person, we are able to call the <i>full_name</i> method in the Person class definition from instances of Friend.
		Like Coworker, Friend has all of the same attributes as Person, it just extends the abilities of Person. Also, like Coworker, Friend creates
		instances variables called <i>first_name</i> and <i>last_name</i>. Again, we want to create these instance variables from the parent's
		__init__ method. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>The final class in this program is called Family. This class varies slightly from Coworker and Friend in its inheritance scheme. We want
	    this class to inherit from both Person and Friend. We need it to inherit from Person so that we can easily define first_name and last_name
		instance variables and still get the functionality of Person's full_name method. We also want to use the change_phone method defined within
		the Friend class. To get the functionality of both, we can choose to inherit from the Friend class. This works because Friend inherits from
		Person, giving us the functionality of both classes if we inherit from Friend. In Family's __init__ method, when we call super().__init__,
		phone will be initialized from Friend and the Friend class will pass first_name and last_name to Person so that they can be initialized there.
