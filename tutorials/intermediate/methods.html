	  <h3>The Basics</h3>
	  <p>Methods are what adds functionality to our classes. Methods look and act just like functions, but they are defined in and belong to
	    a class. We can define a class that only contains class variables (also called <i>class attributes</i>), but this is pretty much pointless because
		objects that we create from it won't do anything. This is where methods come in to play! With methods, we can create instances from our
		classes that are more unique and interesting than instance_one and instance_two that we created in the last tutorial!
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Methods are the equivalent of functions, but are used in OOP. They define the operations that we can perform on instances and classes.
	    Classes can have more than one method and, more often than not, they do. Just remember, a class should only really do one thing, if a
		class definition gets huge; we should probably restructure our program. Generally speaking, methods only have access to the data of the
		instance that they are used on. As you will learn in later tutorials, this is not always the case, this is just the most common case
		for methods. Succinctly put, methods are a procedure associated with an object which is defined by a class.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>self</h3>
	  <p>Before we go any further, I thought that I'd introduce the <i>self</i> argument that is often times used as the first argument
	    in methods. With classes, usually, 
	    methods are used to manipulate instances in some way. Often times, we want a method to only manipulate the instance that we use it on.
		(This is not the only use for <i>self</i>, but it is one of the main ones.) To do this, we have to pass the instance to the method as
		the first argument. When you see methods that have <i>self</i> as the first argument, this argument is actually passing the instance that
		you call the method on to the method. By passing the instance to a method through <i>self</i>, we can use dot notation to only manipulate
		data within the instance passed to the method. You can think of <i>self</i> like the <i>this</i> keyword used in languages like Java and C++. Although
		<i>self</i> in Python is similar to <i>this</i> in other languages, they are not exactly the same.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>The only thing that matters about the <i>self</i> argument is its position. You could use <i>this</i> in place of <i>self</i> and your program
	    would work exactly the same way. Just remember, the first argument in methods (not all methods but we'll get to that later) refers to
		the instance that you call the method on. The first argument can be anything you want, but I recommend that you always use <i>self</i>.
		Using <i>self</i> is a strong Python convention and you might confuse people who have to read your code if you use any other name.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <h3>A first look</h3>
	  <p>As I said earlier, methods look and work just like functions. Methods are defined within a class and use self as the first argument (usually).
	    Let's create an example class that has two methods -- method_1 and method_2. All these methods will do, is print their name. Notice how we use
		"self" as the first argument? This argument refers to the instance, for example, if we write: instance = Example(), the name of this instance
		is <i>instance</i>. Now if we write: instance.method_1(), this will call method_1 and pass <i>instance</i> as the first argument (self) to the
        method.		
		We can create instances, and call these methods on the instances that we create by using the syntax: instance_name.method_name().
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Example</span>:<br>
		  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">method_1</span>(self):<br>
		  3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"This is method 1"</span>)<br>
		  4.<br>
		  5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">method_2</span>(self):<br>
		  6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"This is method 2"</span>)
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>To the right, we have a class with two methods -- <i>method_1</i> and <i>method_2</i>. These are probably two of the most rudimental methods
	    that you will ever see. All that both of these methods do, is print their name. We can create instances of the class and call these methods
		on them. Because of the <i>self</i> argument, now we are only able to call these methods on instances. We cannot call the method directly
		from the class. If we try, we will get a TypeError because no instance will be passed as the first argument. Have a look at the interactive session
		to see exactly what I mean.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> e1 = Example()<br>
		  >>> e1.method_1()<br>
		  This is method 1<br>
		  >>> e1.method_2()<br>
		  This is method 2<br>
		  >>> <br>
		  >>> <span class="light-gray"># This wont work</span><br>
		  >>> Example.method_1()
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>Notice how we are able to call the methods on instances, but not the class itself. This is because of the <i>self</i> argument. When we
        use <i>self</i> as the first argument, we are really passing; or trying to pass; an instance to the method. This is done by default when calling a method
		on an instance. Likewise, if there was no <i>self</i> argument in the method definitions, we could call the methods on the class object, 
		but not instances of the class.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Let's create the same class without the <i>self</i> first positional argument. This will reverse what happens when we call the method on
	    class and the instances of the class. Without the <i>self</i> argument, if we try to call the method on instances, we will get a Type Error. This
		is because the instance will try to pass itself as the first argument to the method and the method does not accept any arguments. However,
		if we call the method on the class, it works because the method does not require an argument and the class, unlike instances of the class,
		does not pass itself as an argument to the method. 
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example right">
	    <code>
		  1. <span class="green">class</span> <span class="blue">Example</span>:<br>
		  2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">method_1</span>():<br>
		  3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"This is method 1"</span>)<br>
		  4.<br>
		  5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">def</span> <span class="blue">method_2</span>():<br>
		  6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="green">print</span>(<span class="red">"This is method 2"</span>)
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>In this example, we are only able to call the methods on the class, but not the instances. This is because when we try to call the method
	    using an instance of the class, it will pass itself as the first argument and the method does not take any arguments. We can call it from
		the class because there are no arguments so it just acts as a direct extension of the class itself. Let's look at an interactive Python 
		session to demonstrate this (assuming that the class has been imported).
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <div class="code-example left">
	    <code>
		  >>> Example.method_1()<br>
		  This is method 1<br>
		  >>> Example.method_2()<br>
		  This is method 2<br>
		  >>> instance = Example()<br>
		  >>> <br>
		  >>> <span class="light-gray"># This wont work</span><br>
		  >>> instance.method_1()
		</code>
	  </div>
	  <p>See how the methods will work if we call them directly off of Example? It is also important to note, that with no arguments, we are not 
	    able to call the methods from instances of the class. This is because the instance tries to pass itself as the first argument to the method
		and the methods of this class accept no arguments. You can do pretty much 
		anything with a method that you can do with a function. Methods can accept more than one argument, just like functions. They can also call 
		other methods from within the class or functions from outside the class. Methods are a very flexible part of OOP.
	</div>
	<div class="p-container">
	  <p>Our classes can now have 
		class attributes as well as methods. There are, however, special methods that make OOP much more useful and interesting than anything
		that we have done so far. We will take a look at a few of these special methods in the next tutorial.
